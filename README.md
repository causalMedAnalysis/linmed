linmed is a stata module to perform causal mediation analysis using linear models for both the mediator and outcome. Two models are 
estimated: a model for the mediator conditional on treatment and baseline covariates (if specified) after centering them 
around their sample means, and a model for the outcome conditional on treatment, the mediator, and the baseline covariates 
after centering them around their sample means.
